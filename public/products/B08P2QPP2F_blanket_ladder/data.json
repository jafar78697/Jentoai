    "comment 3": "Love it! It is a bit crooked in place, maybe how I screwed it in place. It is sturdy for my blankets I want to keep in the living room. the color is cute! Height it perfect and love how hardware was included. Definitely good value! - Hailey",
    "comment 4": "Purchased \u2018rustic hickory\u2019 but received \u2018smoked hickory\u2019 which is not even a color option/description available. Comes folded up with hinges and straightens out as the rungs are installed. Outer screw holes are covered with stickers that only match certain areas of the posts. I\u2019m sure it will do the job but I felt the picture looked better than the actual product. The boards don\u2019t have a rustic appearance at all which would have matched my other furniture. - MamaFox33",
    "comment 5": "I really like these blanket ladders. I ordered one for my basement and one for my main floor. Good quality on carpet and easy to assemble. I can fit 4 decent sized blankets without them touching the ground. - Danielle R.",
