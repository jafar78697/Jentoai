    "comment 4": "The Utopia Towels 4-Pack Cabana Stripe Beach Towels are absolutely perfect for beach trips, pool days, or just lounging in the sun! The cabana stripe design is vibrant and stylish, and the colors really pop. They add a fun, tropical vibe to any beach day.The towels are super absorbent and soft, making them ideal for drying off quickly after a swim. They\u2019re also large enough to give you plenty of space to lounge comfortably. Despite being highly absorbent, they dry quickly and maintain their softness even after multiple washes.The 4-pack is a great deal, and the quality of the towels is impressive for the price. They\u2019re thick, but not too heavy, making them easy to pack for travel or store. I\u2019ve used these towels several times now, and they\u2019ve held up wonderfully without fading or fraying.If you're looking for affordable, high-quality beach towels that look great and perform well, these are a must-have! - Jennifer Sauer",
    "comment 5": "When we went on a family vacation to Hawaii I wanted to get towels that were big, but I wouldn\u2019t be too upset price wise if they didn\u2019t make it home. These towels are perfect. The different colors allowed us to allot the towel to a kid and luckily each kid wanted a different color so there was no fighting! - Allie Smith",
