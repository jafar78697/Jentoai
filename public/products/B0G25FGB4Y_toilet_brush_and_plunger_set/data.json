    "comment 1": "Brilliant design and cleaning power. I\u2019ve come accustomed to using the single use throw away scrub pads but noticed they were only doing half the work necessary. The silicone brush is unique and it cleans really well. It was easy to get the trouble areas (under the lip of the bowl) without having to scrub too long. The caddy/holder keeps nasty toilet water from getting all over the floor, so I don\u2019t mind this one staying next to the toilet.i haven\u2019t had to use the pumice stone yet, but comparing it to my others around the house, this one seems just as good. I love that I have the option to attach it to the wand too. This is a very good scrubber and a great value! - Crystal R",
    "comment 2": "This toilet brush set is very effective and well designed for regular bathroom cleaning. The silicone brush cleans thoroughly without scratching and is easy to rinse clean after use. The long, non slip handle makes it comfortable to use and keeps hands away from the bowl.The included pumice stone is a great addition for tackling tougher stains when needed. I also like that the holder can be wall mounted or floor standing, which helps keep the bathroom organized. Overall, this is a practical and versatile toilet cleaning set that works well. - An Diep",
