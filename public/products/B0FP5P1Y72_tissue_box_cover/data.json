    "comment 2": "If I could give 4.5 stars, I would! This is a super cute tissue cover, and I actually plan to use it as a paint brush holder or vase for faux florals, since it has such a neutral but still attractive design making it versatile. It would go with almost any decor (not all, obviously), which is great for long term use and styles change. My only issue, which really is minor, are ceramic flaws, with small knobby bits right around the top opening. Most probably wouldn\u2019t notice, but now that I\u2019ve seen it I will always see it. It\u2019ll likely be covered but for $20+ I\u2019d like to not have a manufacturing flaw right on the top. I also wish it has felt feet rather than these cheap foam ones that aren\u2019t placed super evenly. I\u2019m overly analytical though and recognize it\u2019s being very particular, which is why I\u2019d really give it 4.5 stars if I could because it is a cute piece!It\u2019s comparable to something you\u2019d get at Target, so if you\u2019ve always been satisfied with Target home decor purchases, expect the same with this in terms of look and quality! - Caitlin",

    "comment 4": "This tissue box cover adds a nice decorative touch, especially if you enjoy a light, farmhouse style. The white ceramic tulip design is simple yet has some character. It blends well with neutral decor and looks neither cheap nor overly shiny.The ceramic feels sturdy and heavy, so it seems unlikely to chip from everyday use. The tulip details are molded cleanly, not blurry or messy, and the finish is smooth to the touch. Mine had no rough edges or obvious paint flaws.Standard square tissue boxes fit inside easily. You place it over the box and pull the first tissue up through the opening. Once in place, the box stays put and does not rattle when you grab a tissue. Because it is ceramic, I prefer to place it on a flat, stable surface, such as a counter, nightstand, or desk, to prevent accidental knocks.Visually, it fits well in a bathroom, bedroom, or home office. The white color makes it easy to match with other accessories, such as soap dispensers, trays, or small vases. If you like cohesive decor, this is a simple way to dress up a plain cardboard tissue box and make it appear more intentional.A couple of small notes: since it is ceramic, it can break if dropped, so it might not be the best choice for busy areas where it could get knocked off a shelf. Also, it is designed for standard square tissue boxes. Extra-large or oddly shaped boxes will not fit.Overall, this is a good quality decorative cover that turns an everyday item into something nicer to look at. If you enjoy clean white ceramic decor with a subtle floral pattern and need a reusable way to conceal store-branded tissue boxes, this is a good value. - Customer Review",
    "comment 5": "This ceramic tissue box holder is quite nice: it has a simple embossed design that is casual yet elegant and attractive. The neutral color is subtle and would fit with any decor, but also doesn\u2019t \u201ctake over\u201d as a visual focus. The ceramic body is thick enough to be sturdy, making it heavy enough to stay put when you pull out a tissue, but not too heavy for use. It has small pads on the bottom to protect and prevent damage to any surface on which it is placed. - Jean L",
