    "comment 4": "Works great. We bought it for our kids bathroom. It reduces the amount of different body washes in the bathtub. It reduces waste as they are not playing with the body wash bottles. It is a good investment. It stuck easily to the tile on the tub and is very durable. No complaints. I used my label maker to put each kid's name on each dispenser. - P.T.",
