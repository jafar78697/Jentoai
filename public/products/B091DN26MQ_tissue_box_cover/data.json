    "comment 1": "This leather-look square tissue box cover is such a pleasant surprise. It looks much more expensive than it is\u2014really well made, sturdy, and easy to use. The strap across the bottom is a great touch\u2014it keeps the tissue box securely in place, so you can pick it up and move it without anything slipping out. The color adds a nice accent wherever you put it. I included a picture so you can see how nice it looks. For the price and quality, this one\u2019s a definite recommend! - Armour Home",
