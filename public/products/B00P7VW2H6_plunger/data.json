    "comment 1": "I love this plunger, it works great, and I flush toilet a couple more times to give plunger a good rinse to keep the container clean.  I keep it in a corner that is discret, and it is not bad looking.  I had my last one for 12 years, and the container finaly split , making sense due to the age of it. - HONEST ONE!",
    "comment 2": "First and foremost it works.  It\u2019s the good style with the inside flange that doesn\u2019t squirt you in the face when you\u2019re plunging hard and late to work.  Second it blends in with my decor I\u2019m all about the white.  It\u2019s nonstick so all the nasty stuff just falls off in the toilet and it hides away nicely in its little home. Great plunger at a great price from a brand I trust! - Eric Olafsen",
    "comment 3": "The Clorox Toilet Plunger with Hideaway Caddy is a practical and well-designed addition to any bathroom. It\u2019s effective at unclogging toilets, sturdy in construction, and comes with a storage caddy that keeps things clean and organized.The plunger itself has a strong rubber suction cup that works efficiently on most toilet types. I used it to deal with a stubborn clog, and it cleared it in just a few attempts. The handle is comfortable to grip and provides good leverage, making the process less of a hassle.The standout feature is the hideaway caddy. It automatically opens and closes as you remove or replace the plunger, keeping the tool out of sight while maintaining hygiene. The caddy is compact enough to fit in tight bathroom spaces, and its minimalist design blends well with modern bathroom decor.While the product is highly functional, there\u2019s a slight downside: the caddy\u2019s base isn\u2019t weighted enough, so it can tip over easily if bumped. This isn\u2019t a deal-breaker but something to be mindful of if you have a smaller or busier bathroom.Delivery was prompt, and the packaging was secure. Overall, this is a great plunger set that combines effectiveness with thoughtful design. With a slight improvement to the stability of the caddy, it would easily earn 5 stars! - Vkusna",
    "comment 4": "Easy to assemble and to place in bathrooms! A great way to have a plunger out but still have it kind of hidden with great quality! Also, it\u2019s been used so it is very effective in unclogging toilets! I bought three! - L. Horton",
