    "comment 1": "I purchased this dispenser as a trial for my personal home before committing to it more broadly. After using it, I\u2019m very happy with the quality and overall design.The dispenser has a clean, modern look, dispenses a consistent amount of product, and feels sturdier than I expected for the price. Installation was quick and straightforward, and it immediately made the shower feel more organized and elevated.I plan to purchase at least one more for our personal home to keep things consistent, and if it continues to hold up well over time, I\u2019ll be rolling this same model out across multiple guest bathrooms in our short-term rentals. Durability and ease of use are especially important to us, and so far this has checked all the right boxes.I\u2019ll plan to update this review after longer-term use, but at this point I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a stylish, practical dispenser for both home and guest use. - Bethany newlun",
    "comment 2": "This Item is Great. Very Clean Look while being practical and useful. I have been working on my smaller upstairs bathroom to make it more comfortable, functional and visually pleasing.This item was a little smaller than I anticipated but that ended up working out. I noticed that I am wasting less product by not trying to pour shampoo, conditioner and body wash into my hands directly. The unit is well built. Each container is removable for easy refilling and comes with a locking top with a key. I chose not to utilize the stickers that came with it because I liked how it looked without them and I am the only one that uses this bathroom. Thank you for such a great product. - Jason Palmari",
    "comment 3": "I love this thing. It was super easy to install, with no damage at all to my tiles. I\u2019ve had it over 6 months now and it hasn\u2019t budged once! It\u2019s extremely easy to fill/refill and it looks very classy. My one minor complaint is that our shampoo one (which gets used the most because my husband thinks shampoo is all purpose) intermittently gets stuck and you have to wiggle it around to get it to pump again. Bonus points: it\u2019s the perfect gap from the shower wall to put your phone behind it if you are someone who watches YouTube while showering (like the aforementioned husband). - martha berg",
    "comment 4": "I spent a fair amount of time looking at reviews of dispensers like this, but many of them did not seem to hold up long.I finally made a decision to start with this product feeling like I may have to try several to find one that lasts and performs well.After nearly a year of daily use this dispenser is showing no signs of stopping.It was very easy to install with the sticky pad that is provided, and while I had my doubts about the pad sticking for an extended period of time in a shower it has not been a problem.We have shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in ours. From the more runny body wash to the very thick conditioner the dispenser does not leak or have any problems dispensing the different viscosities.The provided labels that you can apply your self if you choose to have also held up well in the shower environment and provide a nice ascetic. Various cleaning agents such as scrubbing bubbles has not degraded the stickers or the print in any way.This product offers so much convenience, declutters your shower and adds a feel of luxury to your life that can\u2019t be beat at this price point. - Amazon Customer",
