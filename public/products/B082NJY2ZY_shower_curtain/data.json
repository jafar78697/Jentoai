    "comment 4": "Good quality curtain. I ended up buying two because I wanted to try out the two different colors. They both had good consistent quality. The big challenge may be finding the color that matches your space. I first tried the linen color. I found a bit too dark for a non-window bathroom then I tried the cream color which ended up being very bland for the space so I stuck with the linen. The color, size, length, weight, and thickness all matched expectations. The price was good at Black Friday values, otherwise, I might have been tempted to keep searching for the perfect color for my space. - Zee",
    "comment 5": "Nice quality  A little challenging to hang. Had to pull hard to separate ring openings on a couple of the rings to loop the curtain rings properly.  Looks nice. - kathleen nolan",
