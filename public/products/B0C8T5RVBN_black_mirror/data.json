    "comment 1": "This mirror absolutely transformed my bathroom from early-2000s beige blah to modern, moody glam. I wanted to update my space without doing a full remodel, and this matte black mirror was the perfect centerpiece for my DIY refresh. You can see from my before-and-after photos, this upgrade turned the entire vibe around.Installation was super straightforward. It\u2019s sturdy but not obnoxiously heavy, and the rounded corners give it that high-end, spa-like feel. The size is generous, plenty of mirror real estate for getting ready without having to jostle for space. I paired it with a matte black faucet and matching light fixture, and now it looks a little more like a boutique hotel bathroom. (Without the boutique hotel price tag.)Also, it doesn\u2019t fog up or warp the reflection like cheap mirrors do, and the anti-rust frame gives me confidence it\u2019ll stay in great shape long-term.If you\u2019re looking to make a statement and you have a screwdriver and a vision, this is the one.Highly recommend for anyone updating a bathroom with style in mind and a budget to respect. - Debbie G.",
    "comment 2": "I\u2019m so happy with this mirror! We used it in our recent bathroom refresh, and it was exactly what we needed. The size is perfect over our 48-inch vanity \u2014 large enough to make a statement without overwhelming the space.The gold finish is beautiful and worked seamlessly with our other gold fixtures and lighting. It feels much more expensive than it actually was, and the clean, modern lines add a really nice touch to the room.If you\u2019re looking for a stylish, affordable mirror that looks high-end, this is a great choice. Highly recommend! - Chloe White",
    "comment 3": "This black metal framed bathroom mirror is the perfect mix of style and simplicity. The sleek frame gives my bathroom a clean, modern look, and the quality feels sturdy and well-made. It was easy to hang and instantly elevated the space without being too flashy. The mirror provides a clear reflection and adds a nice designer touch to my wall. Overall, it\u2019s a beautiful and practical piece that fits perfectly with any d\u00e9cor style. - Christi T",
    "comment 4": "This mirror has heft. Feels high quality with good wall hardware. It's an almost perfect match for Delta Champagne Bronze hardware. Sadly, my mirror had a tiny chip which drives me insane, so I will replace it. - Srslydntknow",
