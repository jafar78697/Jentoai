    "comment 1": "I purchased these towels for my reflexology business.  There on the larger size for hand towels and you can comfortably wrap a man size 14 foot.  I don\u2019t use wet towels, I keep them in my towel warmer and use them as a warm wrap, so I can\u2019t comment on the absorption of these.They are very soft and feel like good spa quality.  I got the dark gray and the color is perfect.  They wash nicely, I noticed reviews stating they create a lot of lint initially but I took a chance because the rest of the comments were great.  I washed before the first use and do not think it was \u201ca lot\u201d of lint. For brand new towels, it didn\u2019t surprise me and they were still very fluffy and dense after washing.  I washed them alone, all 6 of them.  I attached a pic of the lint catcher to show.I plan on getting more to replace my old ones. - sleepy",
    "comment 2": "Like these towels! Washed as soon as arrived, no color change after wash, very absorbent, look great, nice and fluffy. I bought the gray color - velvet sheets",
    "comment 3": "Soft, absorbent, nice weight, dry quickly, beautiful color, great value for the money. - Awesome Possum",
    "comment 4": "While not the most luxurious towels, these are pretty decent. They dry well and retain moisture as they should. I use them to dry my face after cleansing and they are the perfect size for it. Despite their dark color, my face wash hasn\u2019t caused any bleaching or color loss. - JNichole",
    "comment 5": "The towels are very, very nice. I am really enjoying them. They are soft easy to fold and they are big because I love the big ones. - Debra K Griffin",
