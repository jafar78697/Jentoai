    "comment 1": "I ordered other dispensers and had to return them. This was my next choice and it should have been my first choice. I love the quality and the pumps actually work! A beautiful addition to my master bathroom. Holds a lot of soap/shampoo/conditioner without leaking out. I am not using the mounts at this time but feel that if I did, they would be easy to install and would last. - Renee H",
    "comment 2": "These are such high quality and so far good on how they adhere to the shower tile. I would definitely recommend getting these. They make my shower look like a high end resort. Very easy to install. - Patricia",
    "comment 3": "super sturdy, left it for 24 hours and it\u2019s ready to use. I was worried with the adhesive at first because it\u2019s tiny, but actually, I didn\u2019t need much. I\u2019ve been pumping real hard but it won\u2019t budge at all and on top of that, it looks slick and amazing. - batang quiapo",
    "comment 4": "Installed these in our guest bathroom. A very clean nice look. I wish they had an option for more simple labels. I ordered some off of Amazon to use instead of the ones that came with them. We ordered another set for our kids bathroom because we liked the way they looked and kept bottles off of the ledge of the shower. - Amazon Customer",
    "comment 5": "The quality of the bottles and the metal brackets far exceeded my expectations. These are incredible. We opted to purchase strong indoor/outdoor double sided tape from Ace Hardware instead of using the glue that came with it, to be safe in our rental. Seriously though, worth the purchase. - Zachary",
