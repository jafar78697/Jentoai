    "comment 1": "We had a Munchkin one for my son who is 4 and it kept sliding around. This one has been great. Cleaned the tub well, stuck this down and its not moving. My son feels a lot safer taking a shower now. Its also longer than the other one - Amazon Customer",
    "comment 2": "This may fits perfectly in our long bathtub  it\u2019s easy to clean and non slip. Just bought a second one! - Savanna",
    "comment 3": "This doesn't slip at all. It's great. - Amazon Customer",
    "comment 4": "I was specifically looking for an extra-large mat to cover the entire bottom of our tub, and this one fits the bill perfectly. The 40-inch length is fantastic and provides wall-to-wall coverage, which gives me a lot more peace of mind. The suction cups on the bottom are no joke; once you press it down on a clean, wet surface, this mat does not move at all. The pebble design feels comfortable on my feet, and the drain holes work well, so I don't end up standing in a puddle.My only minor issue is that the top surface itself can feel a little slick when it gets covered in soapy water, so I still find myself being a bit cautious. It's not dangerously slippery, but it's not as grippy as I thought it might be. Also, there was a bit of a plastic smell right out of the package, but it went away after the first wash. Speaking of which, being able to toss it in the washing machine is a huge plus for keeping it clean. Overall, it's a solid mat that does its job well. - KCSP20489",
