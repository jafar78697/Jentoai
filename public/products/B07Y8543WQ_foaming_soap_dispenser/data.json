    "comment 1": "I\u2019ve used these for a month now and they work great.  The large capacity lets you go longer before refilling.  Looks good on my counters. - Pat",
    "comment 2": "These were inexpensive and they suit my needs perfectly. I wanted to start using foaming hand soap at all my sinks in the house. I recharge the foaming soap pumps from a bulk container of Castile soap and water. These work great.These are lightweight, but they\u2019re sturdy enough to stand up to teenage boys. There\u2019s nothing fancy about them, but they\u2019re unobtrusive enough to be nice by the sink. It\u2019s nice to find a product that is affordable and suits my needs. - Sunflower Grl",
    "comment 3": "Work great! Pump movement is smooth and makes a great foam of soap. Would buy again. - Janet Carlow",
    "comment 4": "Very cute looking but the pumps could be better - Jessica Meyer",
    "comment 5": "I tested both immediately upon purchase to make sure they worked so I could return if not. Worked great with the test batch of soap - nice thick foam that came out well on both bottles. I put them away planning to use one for hand soap after the dispenser I was using ran out and planning to use the other for body wash. When I mixed the body wash and water in the one, it didn't create foam at all. It just squirt out a very slightly sudsy but very watery mess that then wouldn't suds up on my pouf. I fought with this for weeks and then finally switched to the other bottle with the same result. I then made a mix of the handwash that I'd tested originally, and neither one would create the nice foam. Instead it was a drippy mess. Aside from the test run, the pump doesn't work well on either one to push through the mixture to create a lovely foam. Instead it hangs up on both bottles, though one is worse, and gives just a drippy sudsy water. Stay away from this cheap China crap. - winteroses",
