    "comment 1": "I had a new shower installed with big glass doors. I will tell you this, this is the best squeegee I have ever seen. I simply clean it really quick when I am done showering and there are no streaks and no water spots on my glass! The squeegee works extremely well! It is well-made and easy to hang up. No drilling just hang it on a ledge. - Angela Vlasic",
    "comment 2": "Yes, this was an expensive squeegee, BUT it is more effective and efficient than any others I\u2019ve ever owned (no streaks/droplets left behind after just one pass!), and I love that you can hang it over the shower door or from the shower caddy! It\u2019s quite heavy in a good way; I\u2019m a petite female and have no issues using it but am just pointing out how sturdy it is. I can see this lasting for many, many years. Definitely top of the line. - StacyM",
    "comment 3": "I just tried it, and it works well!  What a nice design and a nice, balanced 'feel'!  Nicely soft 'blade' that feels like it will stay soft and workable for a long time.  My last squeegee was in two pieces, and it did not take long for that to fall apart.  This is one piece, so no issues there.  Yes, I will buy this one again! - charljane",
    "comment 4": "Stays put when hanging in glass stall area, ergonomically smooth lines, and works like a charm to clean with no streaks. I really did not want to have a shower squeegee hanging in my shower stall but I don't mind this one as it does look kind of sleek. - Lisa M.",
    "comment 5": "This is a great shower 1pc squeeze. It\u2019s covered in silicone and easy to grip. Plus you can hang it just about anywhere. There is also no rust or dripping from this product. It has a good weight and width and easy to use  it also comes in a few different colors.Definitely worth the money. $$ - Joy D",
