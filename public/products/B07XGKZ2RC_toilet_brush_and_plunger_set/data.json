    "comment 2": "We needed plungers for 4 bathrooms and didn\u2019t want to spend a ton of money but wanted them to work and these are great quality. Shipped fast and work well!! - Rachael LaBounty",
    "comment 3": "It's been a little over 4 years since I bought this combo...and for the first 3 years it worked as it should. So 5 stars for that...at the time I actually bought a set for every bathroom and I have 4 bathrooms.A little over a year ago the plungers just gave it up. (3 yr lifespan) I don't know if the rubber got too old and degraded but the tapered flange (the piece that sticks into the hole in the toilet) just collapsed in on itself and no matter how many times you pulled it back out - it would collapse again. Weirdly enough it happened to 2 of my 3 downstairs toilets within about a 2 weeks of each other so now I have one left downstairs. The upstairs one is becoming a little finicky but doesn't get the use the downstairs ones do. I imagine though that we are only one good clog away from losing that little guy too.The age of the set has created another issue; I couldn't figure it out for a while but I kept noticing black scrub marks on the bowl of 2 of our toilets that worsened over time. Turns out the black brush looks terrific and in good shape but its worn out and leaving black wire marks on the toilet when you brush.The old adage, \"they don't make 'em like the used to\" is an apt one, As newlyweds in 1992 my husband bought a wooden red plunger from the hardware store. (We kept hidden in the garage) We moved in 2007 and the plunger is still here. It's still just as ugly, and doesn't have the tapered flange for our modern toilets...but it is 34 years old and bailed us out when the two new models failed.Seriously though, this is a really good product-but it just isn't going to last 34 years, but I still recommend the set.  I much prefer the aesthetics of the black over the white because the white brushes show EVERYTHING if you don't clean it well - and you will want it clean for a bathroom set everyone can see. - DTMEDIC",
    "comment 4": "I have a small half bath and purchased this since it\u2019s a compact set with toilet brush and plunger. The toilet brush gets weekly use and it\u2019s held up well. It does a good job of cleaning my toilet. The plunger looks sturdy enough. I haven\u2019t had to use it yet. Will update my review after using it. - seamaiden",
    "comment 5": "I ordered this plunger  from Amazon and received it the same day. I had a severely backed up toilet that would not go down  at all when using the plungers I have already have at home,  no matter how hard I tried and  I tried all morning and mid-afternoon and nothing happened. I am so impressed with this plunger. It got the job done very very fast with little to no residue on it, so the clean up was very easy.  I would recommend this plunger to anyone, you won't be disappointed. Great Job MR. SIGA , you got my vote!!!!! - Katherine Daniels",
