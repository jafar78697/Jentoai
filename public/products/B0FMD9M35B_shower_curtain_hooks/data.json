    "comment 1": "I love these. They are pleasant to look at and very easy to use. One hook holds shower liner and shower curtain. Makes it very easy to remove either one for washing. Nice quality, holds well and slides easy. I'd buy them again. - KathyF",

    "comment 3": "Perfect weight and thickness. Good quality. Standard size for regular shower bar. Ease of opening package, including hanging on the shower bar. Makes it very easy to hang, wash, and replace both the shower curtain or the liner. Very happy with the purchase. Excellent value for the money! - DangriestOnE",
    "comment 4": "They\u2019re not bad - especially for the price - but they will eventually rust.  I\u2019m about to replace them.  Here is a picture of them after about a year and a half of daily shower exposure.  I\u2019m just going to buy the same ones because I love how easily I can change the liner and curtain. - Jaime Carter",
