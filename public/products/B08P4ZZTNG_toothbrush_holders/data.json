    "comment 1": "What a nice toothbrush holder!  It will hold up to 4 brushes with an open section for (in my case) paper cups.  You could fit a tube of toothpaste (maybe two) in it as well.  It\u2019s not big if you don\u2019t have a lot of counter space.  The bottom has metal rows to keep the brushes from sliding around.  Here\u2019s what I thought was nice \u2026 it came with two extra rubbery replacement feet!  It\u2019s stable and looks nice too.  Great price! - Ginger",
    "comment 2": "It's pretty decently made. Holds exactly what I need it to which is simply 1 toothbrush and 1 tube of toothpaste. You can fit up to 4 toothbrushes and probably 3 tubes if you have other family members or somebody uses something different. So far it's holding up great and looks nice. Simple construction, does what you'd expect. - Jon",
    "comment 3": "Perfect size. Perfect construction. Simple and sleek (I got the stainless Steel.)  I like how the residual water from the toothbrush can\u2019t  collect in the bottom of it with the  open grate bottom. Before, I had a decorative cup and it start making a sludge with an odor that collects on the toothbrush Handle. This prevents that bc no water can collect! And it\u2019s small enough to fit on a small sink but big enough for 4 people\u2019s toothbrushes plus paste and the way It\u2019s constructed, the toothbrushes Don\u2019t touch! It\u2019s honestly perfect. And for the price! Even better! - Leslie P.",
    "comment 4": "I've been on a mission to declutter my tiny bathroom counter, and this Urbanstrive 304 Stainless Steel Toothbrush Holder has been an absolute lifesaver. After a couple of months of daily use, it's held up beautifully\u2014no rust, no wobbling, just pure organization bliss. If you're tired of toothbrushes rolling around or toothpaste tubes taking over your sink, this is the upgrade you need.What I Love:Premium Build That Lasts: Made from rust-proof 304 stainless steel with a glossy black finish, it looks modern and upscale without feeling cheap. The material is corrosion-resistant, perfect for steamy bathrooms, and it hasn't shown any signs of wear or fading. Plus, the 18-month warranty gives me total peace of mind.Smart, Versatile Storage: The slim design (just 4.81 x 2.36 x 4.13 inches) fits four toothbrushes (including electric ones) and one full-size toothpaste tube perfectly, with precise slots that grip without squeezing. I've even squeezed in a shaver, facial cleanser bottle, and a small comb\u2014it's surprisingly roomy for its footprint. The open bottom with ventilation slots lets water drain quickly, preventing mold or that gross trapped moisture I had with my old holder.Rock-Solid Stability: Those non-slip rubber feet are no joke\u2014they keep it planted firmly on any surface, even my slick quartz countertop. No more tipping over when grabbing a brush in the morning rush. It's heavy enough to feel substantial but light to move if needed.Any Downsides?The slots are tailored for standard sizes, so super-oversized electric toothbrush heads or jumbo toothpaste tubes might not fit as snugly. But for everyday use, it's spot-on. Also, the black finish shows fingerprints a tad more than I'd like, but a quick wipe with a microfiber cloth keeps it gleaming.Final Verdict:This Urbanstrive holder isn't just functional\u2014it's a stylish addition that makes my bathroom feel more spa-like and less chaotic. It keeps everything hygienic, accessible, and dry, turning a mundane routine into something effortless. Highly recommend for small spaces or anyone wanting a durable, no-fuss organizer. I've already gifted one to my sister, and she's obsessed too! - Biv",
