    "comment 1": "It's simple. These are luxury items at a ridiculously fair price. Every time I use one (And I use nothing else now that I have them) I feel like I am in a luxury hotel or a resort or something. They are so soft and absorbent, big enough to wrap me in comfort and luxury but not too bit for the washer and dryer. They look like a rich person's towel, they feel like it too and they dry amazingly quickly. There is nothing not to like about these towels. And if they ever wear out (Which I doubt they will do for a long long time), I will buy them again. - John",
    "comment 2": "I was surprised and impressed with the quality of these cloths. They are not the typical thin cheap cloths or the microfiber cloths. These cloths are soft yet nice and thick but not as thick as a bath wash cloth. They are perfect for residential kitchen use. You won't be disappointed with these cloths. - Diane MacKay",
    "comment 3": "\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fAs a frequent buyer, I\u2019m very happy with these Utopia Towels washcloths. They\u2019re soft, absorbent, and hold up well after multiple washes. Great quality for the price, and the 24-pack is super convenient. I\u2019ve reordered and would definitely recommend them. - Obie Cintron",
    "comment 4": "So far so good. I can\u2019t believe an entire pack did not shed in the wash! I always hesitate when washing new towels or bedding because of the lint factor. This had very little shedding. It was amazing to wash cloths are a good size they do the job I use them nightly for washing my face. I do wish that the smaller packet had come in a purple because I would\u2019ve scooped that up. I don\u2019t know what I would do with a large amount of washcloths I don\u2019t need that many.These are sturdy wash cloth that wash up well and do the job other than the color. My preference is to have a thicker washcloth and these definitely are mid range thin. Not see-through but not thick. I like the size. Reserving these for face wash they do show some staining from make up. Because they are white and I\u2019m not one to continually scrub and bleach washcloths. - Ann&Earl",
    "comment 5": "Got these to replace our old ones. They are great. Soft, good quality, and exactly what we were looking for. We use them as reusable paper towels and these are great quality and don\u2019t burn easy, which is great when they get used in the kitchen. And they are way more absorbent than the average paper towel and much softer on the skin. - Rukkia",
