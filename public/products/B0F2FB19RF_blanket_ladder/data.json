    "comment 1": "Very well packed and easy instructions to follow.  Looks beautiful, can now hold my blankets and even I added plants on the top shelf.  Will purchase again.  Stability is good and weighs perfect.  Will purchase again. - Ani",
    "comment 2": "Easy assembly,  looks just like advertisement - Michael Kayleen Martin",
    "comment 3": "This ladder is lightweight and easy to assemble, which is a plus. It holds up well when used to display blankets, and I\u2019ve even received a couple of compliments on its appearance. However, the overall quality feels very cheap, and I was on the fence about keeping it. While it works for light decorative use, I wouldn\u2019t choose this ladder again for myself or as a gift. It\u2019s a decent budget-friendly option but might not meet expectations for durability or premium quality. - Sandra McGarey",
    "comment 4": "It was a little flimsy for the price, and was missing a foot pad, but I made it work. Aside from that, I'm happy with it. Installation was not difficult. It's nice and light. Functionally, I think it will serve it's purpose. - Kristi Solar",
