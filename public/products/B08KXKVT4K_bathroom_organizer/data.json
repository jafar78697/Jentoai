    "comment 1": "These are nice small little drawer organizers. They were smaller than I imagined. However, they fit very well in drawers and I was able to get more in a drawer to keep everything stored away nicely. Nice quality and looks clean. - powerofdiscernment",
    "comment 2": "I'll make thus short and sweet. BUY THESE! The selling point on this product is that they have little rubber feet that you stick on the bottom so that the bins don't move around. They stay where you put them. Price is great for the amount you receive and it's a sturdy product, well enough made. And it's come in all kinds of colors!  Organize till your heart is content. You won't be upset with this simple purchase, that can make you feel so happy when you're finished with the task of organizing like a professional. - shadowdoll",
