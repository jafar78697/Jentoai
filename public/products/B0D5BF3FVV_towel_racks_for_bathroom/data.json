    "comment 1": "Solid does the primary job of holding towels when pulled or added to rack. Clean lines easy to line up. Screws hold the bar up well. Dark is a neutral like silver and like the look in bathroom. I think having a screw in center or bar helps with additional weight support for towels. Very sturdy and attractive. - Kellie",
    "comment 2": "Very sturdy with elegant decor appearance. Hardware included with easy installation. - MKelly",
    "comment 3": "Very nice choice. Good size for a bathroom and very easy to install with the included drywall anchors. Although I do have some other bigger ones that I use because I already had them. Easy to mark these small screws. Feels pretty sturdy. - Angel",
    "comment 4": "Product works great, has just the right clearance for a normal towel. You won't smack your hand taking the towel off or putting it over the railing.  4 stars due to the very, very cheap anchor screw sets, & lack of details in the instructions.  Use your own plastic anchor mounts. Lightweight, goes together easy. Seems to be sturdy for the time. - garren carter",
    "comment 5": "This towel rack is very nice and it even looks elegant easy to put together convenient and it will last a long time. - Celeste locke",
