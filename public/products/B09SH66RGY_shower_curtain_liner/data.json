    "comment 1": "I\u2019m really impressed with this shower curtain. The material feels sturdy and good quality, not thin or cheap. It fits perfectly in my bathroom and keeps the water inside the shower without sticking to the body.The design looks great and matches the pictures. It was very easy to install and after several uses, it still looks new. Definitely a great value for the price. I would buy it again. - Josue",
    "comment 2": "Great liner for the price. Does the job! - Free Your Mind",
    "comment 3": "Nice and heavy. The magnets are decent, but good be a little stronger. No weird smell when originally removed from the packaging. - Outdoor extension plug",
    "comment 4": "Satisfied with this purchase as I wanted a lighter weight less rigid shower curtain. Serves the purpose and at a reasonable price. - SAK",
    "comment 5": "I got this EHZNZIE shower curtain liner I really should have looked at the description better.Because it says lightweight.It's a solid color which I was impressed with that. I was just looking for something a bit thicker is all.I did pay less than $5 for this, so it's one of those \" you get what you pay\" for kind of things.The legnth is exactly as described, the color is bright and not see through at all.It does serve it's purpose, I'm not sure about how easy it would be to wash because it's plastic. I'm sure you can soak it in the tub with some soaps and even maybe bleach and it'd be fine. I typically don't keep them that long and recently discovered it's recommended to dispose and change these every 6 months. (Who knew ?)The look is good. The only thing I'm worried about is that it's going to stick to me when I take a shower. Which I usually weigh them down anyways with shampoo bottles on the inside when I shower anyways. So it may not be a problem as it is.The legnth is fine and was easy to install bi do appreciate it. But only wish It was thicker is all. Nothing wrong with it. Just a little cheaper is all.Honestly this does deserve 5 stars because it planly states in the description which was my fault for not seeing when I purchased this. So all in all, it's a great value for your money. - Rae wertheimer",
