    "comment 1": "So easy to install. It looks great and is well made. I had to change out to the smaller white washer that's included to fit my tub. It works perfectly. So happy with this order. - Placeholder",
    "comment 2": "Very nice looking and an easy update to our older tub.  And really does catch hair, does not leak during a tub soak and stays in place.  It\u2019s a winner for sure - Susan B.",
    "comment 3": "Super elegant and makes every difference in bathtub. Fits right in. - Karinna",
    "comment 4": "I'm mostly impressed with this item.  Fits great and easy to install and looks good.  However there is one thing I am not crazy about.  There is basically no filter in place to stop hairs from going down drain.  The openings on this are basically the same as if you left the drain open...should be some kind of mesh screen or something to catch hairs.  Will have to find a gerri rig something on my own.  But other than that a very nice find. - Art B.",
