    "comment 1": "These are pretty decent for the price. They give a more organic look to your bathroom. They are super light weight and they allow for the water to run from the soap which allows for not as much build up to accumulate. They are easy to use and fit a standard size Dove soap. I didn't have any problems with slipperiness. - BeeP",
