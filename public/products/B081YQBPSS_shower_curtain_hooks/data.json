Makes it very easy to hang, wash, and replace both the shower curtain or the liner. Very happy with the purchase. Excellent value for the money! - DangriestOnE",
    "comment 4": "They\u2019re not bad - especially for the price - but they will eventually rust.  I\u2019m about to replace them.  Here is a picture of them after about a year and a half of daily shower exposure.  I\u2019m just going to buy the same ones because I love how easily I can change the liner and curtain. - Jaime Carter",
