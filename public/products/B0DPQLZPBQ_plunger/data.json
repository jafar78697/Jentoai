    "comment 1": "I was surprised by how practical this plunger is. It comes with its own holder, which makes it much more hygienic and avoids having it lying around the bathroom. The black design looks elegant and discreet, blending nicely with the d\u00e9cor. The size (19 inches) is just right not too big, not too small and it works perfectly for its purposeThe best part is that the base fully covers the plunger, so it\u2019s not visible and doesn\u2019t drip on the floor. It feels sturdy and easy to handle. For the price and quality, I think it\u2019s an excellent purchaseI recommend it if you\u2019re looking for something functional but also stylish for your bathroom. - Susana Leyva",
    "comment 2": "The FORASTO toilet plunger arrived quickly and was well-packaged, ensuring it was discreet and ready for use. It's exactly as described \u2013 a sturdy, 19-inch black plunger that comes with a convenient holder/cover. This design not only keeps it hygienic but also blends nicely with bathroom decor, unlike typical plungers. Functionality-wise, it's very effective. The suction is powerful, clearing clogs quickly and efficiently, making it a reliable tool for any bathroom. It's a practical and aesthetically pleasing solution for an otherwise unglamorous necessity - javier (Molumba)",

    "comment 4": "First let me say I did not know this plunger needed assembly by screwing the 3 parts of the handle together. Seeing I had to assemble it I for sure thought I wasted my money but it is really sturdy and strong. My commode has been clogged half a day so I ordered the plunger and got the same day delivery. I didn\u2019t read the instructions and didn\u2019t realize I needed to pull the end of the plunger out. I plunged the toilet with the end still stuck inside and after only the 2nd time plunging the clog was removed. Due to I just had surgery I was using the plunger with one hand and was barely plunging. So to say that if I was using full force to plunge the clog probably would have been removed on the first try.  Very good plunger get it. - LaToya",
    "comment 5": "was really impressed with this plunger. First of all, the handle is sturdy and has a comfortable grip, which makes it easy to use without slipping. The suction power is strong enough to clear tough clogs quickly, and I didn\u2019t have to use too much force. Another detail I love is the holder \u2014 it keeps the plunger upright, clean, and discreetly stored in the bathroom, which is a big plus for hygiene. The sleek black design also looks modern and doesn\u2019t clash with the bathroom d\u00e9cor. Overall, it\u2019s both functional and well-designed. Definitely a reliable product to have at home. - Asena tu\u011f\u00e7e",
