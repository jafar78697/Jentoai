    "comment 1": "These are really large and made of good-quality silicone. They cover the drain perfectly and seal very well. The white one matches our shower color nicely, which is a bonus. They work exactly as intended\u2014water does not get through\u2014and they\u2019re easy to clean. Simple, effective, and look great. - Bhanuka Senavirathne",
    "comment 2": "These work awesome. The kids can\u2019t slide them around while being rowdy in the bath. No drop of water will penetrate this drain! - Autumn Grable",
    "comment 3": "These drain stoppers are great.  I do recommend the 6 inch, however, as the smaller ones slip and water runs out.I ordered before and now I am ordering another set in case I lose one. - Linda F.",
    "comment 4": "Definitely works. It\u2019s a littler bigger than expected which makes it a little difficult to store when not in use. It\u2019s too big to sit on the ledge of the bathtub. But it works! And my baby is no longer pulling out the drain during his bath which is exactly what we needed this for - Tori",
    "comment 5": "Lost the stopper to the hall bathroom tub so we bought these. They work VERY WELL/ place them in a wet tub and they seal well. The more water in the tub, the less leakage. Filled the tub during hurricane season and it stayed full for 7 days, though a small weight (we use a brick) on top makes them seal like they are glued on. On sinks, they hold water in perfectly yet are easy to pull off. No complaints at all. - Murphydog 12",
