    "comment 1": "So much better than the foam mats ! Drys very fast and looks good , using it for a couple months and no change in color or staining and no issues. The Marnie comes with keeps it n in place too so no sliding ! - Rachael Zorsky",
    "comment 2": "This stone bath mat has been an excellent purchase. It dries incredibly fast, stays clean, and is very easy to maintain. No more soggy or smelly mats\u2014water disappears almost immediately. The quality is great for the price, and it feels sturdy and well-made. I wouldn\u2019t go back to any other type of bath mat after this. Highly recommend! - Sara",
    "comment 3": "I am absolutely loving this stone bath mat! I was a bit skeptical at first since it\u2019s different from a traditional fabric mat, but after using it for a few weeks, I can honestly say I\u2019ll never go back to regular bath mats. This mat is made from diatomaceous earth, which makes it extremely absorbent and quick-drying. The moment you step out of the shower, it instantly soaks up the water from your feet, and within minutes, it\u2019s completely dry again, no more soggy, damp mats lying around. This keeps my bathroom much cleaner and fresher, with no mildew smell. The size is perfect (24\u201d x 16\u201d) \u2014 large enough to step on comfortably but not so big that it takes up too much space. I also appreciate how eco-friendly it is compared to fabric mats that need constant washing. One tip: make sure to place it on a flat surface for best results. If you notice any buildup, a light sanding with the included sandpaper keeps it like new. Overall, this stone bath mat has been a fantastic upgrade. It\u2019s stylish, practical, and incredibly hygienic. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their bathroom clean, dry, and safe. Worth every penny! - Nathali",
    "comment 4": "These mats are fantastic and they work just as described. We have one outside our shower and one outside our sauna. The no-slip/skid under-mat works well to hold them in place, too. They feel great and are comfortable to step on after a shower. The water absorbs and disappears - no wet carpet mats of old for sure. It's a perfect thickness to work almost anywhere and it was hard to beat the price for two of these. - M. Cole",
    "comment 5": "Overall, this stone bath mat is a great find! It looks sleek and modern in my bathroom, and the absorbency is impressive \u2013 it really does dry almost instantly after stepping on it. No soggy bath mats or musty smells, which is a huge plus.The only downside is the size. It\u2019s smaller than I expected, and I wish it covered a bit more area outside the shower. If you have a larger bathroom or just want more coverage, you might want to look for a bigger option.That said, it still works well and does exactly what it claims. Just not quite 5 stars because of the size. - awilli9004",
