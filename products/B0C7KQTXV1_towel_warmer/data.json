    "comment 1": "I got this as a gift for my mom and she loves it! It is perfect for heating your towel while you shower. She also loves throwing in her robe or pajamas to heat up as well. If you bunch your towel up too tight the middle takes a while to heat but otherwise ~15 min is perfect. It is super easy to use and fits multiple towels. - Naomi",
    "comment 2": "Absolutely love this towel warmer. It fits so many towels and the heat levels are great. The quality of this product is great. Perfect for gifts for family and friends. - Amazon Customer",
    "comment 3": "This towel warmer has been an absolute game changer. My wife absolutely loves it\u2014there\u2019s nothing better than stepping out of the shower and wrapping up in a perfectly warm towel. It instantly makes everyday showers feel like a spa experience.She also loves using it to warm up her pajamas before bed, which has become part of her nightly routine. The towels and clothes come out warm and cozy every time, and it\u2019s surprisingly easy to use.If you\u2019re looking to add a touch of comfort and luxury to your daily routine (or make someone you love very happy), this towel warmer is 100% worth it. Highly recommend! - Pippa Baker",
    "comment 4": "EVERYONE NEEDS A TOWEL WARMER! This is the best gift I have ever gotten and I give it as gifts now. It is so easy to use and does not get your towel too hot. It gets it perfectly warm. I also think these look nice in your bathroom because they are so sleek. I also warm up my robe and pajamas before bed. I use this all year long. It is made durable but does not weigh too much. It will not fall over but it\u2019s not hard to move either. - Taylor Ann",
    "comment 5": "Bought it for the cold winter nights in the hot tub.  Keeps everything warm and toasty. The timer function is a great feature. It heats quickly however the continuous heating is a little cooler than we prefer. Nice and convenient even for a normal shower. - eric",
