    "comment 3": "Great concept, but locking function is really not \"lockable\".  Bought it for my Airbnb.  Still very nice though and very easy to hang and label.  I'd still recommend if you aren't concerned with the lock function. - Amanda Jok",

They come with an adhesive pad that screws to the back, and mounting screws depending on which way you would prefer to attach it. I just stuck the adhesive pad on the wall and screwed the bracket to the pad. It seems to hold great! - Nick singleton",
