    "comment 3": "great quality easy to install. great functionality - Bought but missing some of the glass. I wish we could connect the seller and ask if they could send them. Its beautiful but looks weird with missing glasses.",
    "comment 4": "I love the design and the build quality. The only drawback to this set is that the tissue keeps falling off the tissue holder mount. The design and build quality of this set are truly impressive, showcasing a high level of craftsmanship. However, there is one notable drawback: the tissue holder mount does not securely hold the tissue, causing it to fall off frequently. - Michael Terrell",
