    "comment 1": "Didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be impressed by a toilet bowl brush, but here we are. This thing actually does its job really well\u2014sturdy handle, good grip, and the bristles are firm enough to scrub without splashing everywhere. It reaches under the rim easily and doesn\u2019t feel flimsy or cheap. Cleaning the toilet is still not fun, but this brush makes it way quicker and less annoying. Easy to rinse clean and doesn\u2019t hold onto gross residue. Solid purchase, would definitely buy again - Louie",
    "comment 2": "best toilet brush i've had in a long time. unfortunately i deal with toilet mold and so the brush has begun to mold after only maybe 5 months or so. it's super sturdy and strong and really gets the nasty stuff out! including black mold. - bianca jade",
    "comment 3": "You cannot go wrong with a real bowl brush to get out those hard water stains. My water is very hard, but I really do not enjoy the was softeners make my skin feel. So I do with out but that can cause problems - hard water staining in not often used toilet being one that annoys me the most. This brush and its lie named liquid cleaner really do an amazing job in keeping my bowl nice and clean. I use the other Clorox brush item with Scentiva on off weeks to keep the toilet nice and fresh  .. but this beauty helps me remove the staining the other tiny brush sometimes cannot remove. A good brush. I think you will be happy with it if you suffer from hard water as I do. - WilDotCom",
    "comment 4": "It's a good toilet cleaning product for the price. Appearance: the white colored brush is neatly hidden in the white storage holder. The grey bristles for cleaning under the toilet rim would be better if they were thicker, but it cleans the toilet fine and without much effort. Overall, it's easy to use, and the grip is sturdy. - J S Fl",
    "comment 5": "Just what i was looking for.  The bristles are nice and strong.  Love that it has bristles to clean under the rim.  The price was very good.  This definitely cleans my toilet.  I recommend it. - Chris",
