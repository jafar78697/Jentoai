    "comment 1": "I order a lot of things like this because I\u2019m always reorganizing my kitchen and bathrooms. I liked this one because it\u2019s clear so it can match any decor and it\u2019s easy way to clean.There are some awesome features to this product. First, the plastic is very thick. It\u2019s high quality acrylic and I love that because it\u2019s sturdy and won\u2019t be easily break or wear down. It also has removable and adjustable separating parts. You can remove them all and have one large container or you can arrange them however you like. This is great because it will hold groups of items upright like brushes if you use this in a bathroom, or it can hold large groups of things like washed fruit if you want to store this in your refrigerator. The third thing is that it comes with an adhesive strong sticker on the back that you would apply to a flat surface if you wanted to slide the holder onto a wall. What makes this great is that you don\u2019t need to drill or nail anything into the flat surface, you just remove the back of the adhesive and stick it where you want the holder to be and you\u2019re all set. The final great thing that I will point out is the drip tray at the bottom. You can very easily slide that tray out at anytime and anything that has fallen through the holes at the bottom of the tray is caught there. This helps for very easy cleaning if you use this to store wet items like toothbrushes. If you leave the tray in place it is completely unnoticeable.The only thing I don\u2019t like about this is the size but I will say that all of the other heavy duty acrylic holders that I have purchased are also smaller than in comparison to plastic holders I get for the same price. And the acrylic items hold up far better than plastic over time. They don\u2019t break or bend like plastic does. For this reason, I would say that this product is a fair price and I\u2019m giving it five stars. It\u2019s very versatile because it can be used to hold various items and it\u2019s such high quality that you will have it for years. - Super Shopper Mom",
    "comment 2": "Quality is great and very good value, but takes a second to line up the inserts appropriately for stability. This initially collapsed on me like a house of cards on my first try, so don\u2019t be like me, and actually glance at the instructions first. Snap the inserts together before placing inside the main container. Make sure the pieces that insert along the lips inside of the container go on the outside of the lip in each side, which allows the smaller insert to appropriately snap into the bottom hole. Once I did this it was a perfectly stable container with stable compartments. Put this on my husband\u2019s side of the master bath for his toiletries and toothbrush which he tends to leave sprawled out on his counter in a chaotic mess\u2026he hasn\u2019t embraced this yet (you can lead a horse to water, but you can\u2019t force them to drink it). So this at least makes my life easier to keep his things tidy for him as opposed to my usual move of lovingly (*never* annoyed or angrily) throwing his toiletries into his drawers. The acrylic is sturdy and well made with sizable compartments for toothbrushes, paste, electric shaver, nail clippers/tweezers, etc. I recommend this for those loved ones in your life who consider putting things back into their place as optional. - SE",
    "comment 3": "I have looking for something to clear the counter clutter in my kids bathroom. The counter space is tight and they don't have a medicine cabinet or drawer. I have tried to keep things organized but there products keep making there way back to on the countertop.This clear organizer has 3 separate dividers with a large one in the center 2 small ones on the sides. These are optional. The dividers are not fixed. It comes without them installed. It is easy to assemble, about a minute. The back is a strong adhesive that I chose to apply to the mirror. The organizer can be removed from the bracket for easy cleaning. The removable bottom tray can catch water from the toothbrushes, and can be emptied and cleaned.From the pictures it saved lots of space!This product co.es on 2 different colors clear and a clear grey.Pictured is the clear. Overall this a must of you have limited space. I can be installed inside a cabinet too if you don't want it out.Great productfor all kinds of storage. Like make-up hair ties and clips, deodorant and nail clippers and polish. The price is great. - Mandini 99",
    "comment 4": "This clear five-slot toothbrush holder is simple, functional, and exactly what I was looking for. The clear design looks clean and modern, and it blends well with any bathroom d\u00e9cor. It holds multiple toothbrushes easily and keeps everything upright and organized instead of cluttered on the counter.The quality is better than I expected. The plastic is sturdy, not flimsy, and it feels stable when sitting on the sink. Each slot is a good size and spaced well, so the toothbrushes don\u2019t touch or crowd each other.What I really like is how versatile it is. While it works perfectly as a toothbrush holder, it can also be used for other purposes\u2014such as holding makeup brushes, razors, pens, or other small items. Overall, it\u2019s practical, well-made, easy to clean, and very useful. I would definitely recommend it if you\u2019re looking for an affordable way to organize your space. - Pezzy",
    "comment 5": "This toothbrush holder has been such a helpful addition to my bathroom. It has 5 slots, which comfortably hold both electric and manual toothbrushes, and the adjustable divider makes it easy to fit different sizes without the brushes feeling cramped so a whole family of 5 can use. I like that it can sit neatly on the countertop or be mounted on the wall if I want to save space. The detachable drain tray is fantastic as it catches excess water, keeping the surface clean and making cleanup super easy. The holder is made out of thick, solid acrylic so it is durable and not flimsy. Its sleek clear design blends well with my bathroom d\u00e9cor. This can also be used to store makeup, hairbrushes and every day toiletries. Being able to adjust the dividers for any item is a game changer. Definitely recommend. - Alli M",
