    "comment 4": "This toilet brush was extremely easy to put together and is definitely space-saving! It easily fits behind my toilet and looks sleek! It's made of a lightweight plastic but doesn't feel like it will break as soon as it's used. The bristles are stiff and they scrub the toilet bowl efficiently. I definitely recommend this product and love how affordable it was! - Rebecca",
