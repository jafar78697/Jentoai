    "comment 2": "I like this bathroom counter organizer because it keeps everything neat and organized with limited counter space. It's the perfect size for my small bathroom counter. I bought some inexpensive plastic storage boxes to hold my floss picks and interdental brushes for a neater appearance. (See the second picture). I love that the bottom is removable so I can clean it easily. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase and it's a great value too. - Cafelatte54",
