    "comment 1": "Got it for a gift for my husband. He absolutely loves it. Warms up quick and easy. Fits about 3 towels. We got the white one to go with our restroom. It was definitely worth it for us! - Maria Velasquez",
    "comment 2": "I really like this towel warmer and it works great \u2014 it heats up quickly and feels amazing getting out of the shower to a warm towel. My only complaint is the size. It says it holds two towels, but realistically it only fits one regular-sized towel. Other than that, I\u2019m very happy with it and would recommend it. - Jaymie Donner",
