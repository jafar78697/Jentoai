    "comment 1": "This was seriously everything I could have wanted and more. I was looking for a shower curtain with a clip in liner to make keeping clean easier than rubbing cleaner on a plastic liner, but I didn\u2019t want it to look like something out of a hotel, and I found this. And I love it! The fabric is heavy and luxurious feeling, the colors are nice and relaxing in my bathroom, it\u2019s nice and long so I can hang it a little higher for that extra bougie feel, it goes in and comes off easily to clean just the like or the whole thing and all the details were nice and good quality and look great! It\u2019s a heavy duty fabric that doesn\u2019t wrinkle or get stuck in weird places and hangs nicely, the liner stays in place in the other side nicely and keeps all water out entirely. I have it in our stand up shower and it\u2019s perfect! - Amazon Customer",
    "comment 2": "I love this shower curtain. It is a high-end curtain that elevates the aesthetic of my bathroom. Made with a quality linen fabric it offers a soft yet textured appeal to the room and it was easy to install. - Amazon Customer",
    "comment 3": "The liner curtain is also fabric (like a lite nylon maybe?). The outer decorative curtain is very nice boho/farmhouse, not printed design, woven design, cotton or cotton-like fabric. The sheer top part is high enough to still accord privacy to the bather.I love these with the detachable, washable liner!The only thing I'll add is be sure the bottom hem is low enough - if you're using this for a stall shower which typically have a very shallow lip - so the liner doesn't waft to the outside of the lip. - Blue Rose",
    "comment 4": "Cute and neutral.  Textured look & beautiful stitching.  Make sure you pay close attention to your measurements.  This comes in many sizes.  I love the ease of assembly being hookless. - Alicia",
    "comment 5": "So far this seems like a much nicer window shower curtain than what I purchased last time. The outer curtain itself is a heavier, nicer material. And so far, the window doesn't leak like the last one. Looks great - g99",
