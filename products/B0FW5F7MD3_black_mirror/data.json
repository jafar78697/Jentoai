    "comment 1": "This mirror is a beautiful addition to our entrance hallway. The size is just right, and the elegant design really enhances the overall look of the hallway. It reflects light well, which helps brighten the room and makes it feel more open and inviting and also makes the hallway look bigger. Installation was quick and easy, and I love that it can be hung either vertically or horizontally depending on your layout. The mirror itself is very clear and high quality, with no distortion, and the frame feels sturdy and well-made. Two things I would love to see are more size options and additional frame colors. I would definitely consider buying another if more colors of frame were available.Overall, I\u2019m very happy with this purchase. it looks great, works perfectly, and adds a stylish touch to our home. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a nice and elegant mirror. - Pas",
    "comment 2": "Great Wall MirrorI\u2019ve been using this wall mirror for the past few weeks and has been great. I purchased the black finish version and it looks very sleek and modern. The size 30x22 I ordered is perfect for our bathroom. I suggest it being hung vertically so you can get a good perspective of yourself but it can also work horizontally in certain situations. The packaging was great, as it assured that the mirror came intact due to the styrofoam packaging. The image is crystal clear, since the mirror portion was in pristine condition and it clearly allows you to see yourself. It comes with a mounting kit, that made it easy to hang with the simple to follow instructions. Overall I highly recommend this mirror to anyone looking for a modern look that is functional and able to last. - Jeffrey Delapaz",
