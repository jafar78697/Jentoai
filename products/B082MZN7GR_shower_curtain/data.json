    "comment 1": "Beautiful sage green shower curtain! Love that it also comes with the liner so you don\u2019t have to worry about that. The waffle texture is very soft and a good thickness which I expected for the price. Does what it needs to do while being cute. - gobulls2k",
    "comment 2": "Beautifully made shower curtain.  Looks very luxurious and expensive but very reasonably priced.  I was able to put it up in under 5 minutes because I didn't need shower hooks!  The description was spot on.  A good looking white woven curtain and the material is well weighted - not thin or flimsy.  Waterproof part is attached which is great.My only complaint would be that i have to hem it as I didn't realize that the length was so long and I certainly can't make the rod any lower.  However, It is such a great addition to my new bathroom that I will keep it and make it work for me. - Xx",

    "comment 4": "Just great! The sage green is the perfect shade and the cotton is nice and heavy-good weight. And so easy to put up! I\u2019m  so pleased with this shower curtain and it\u2019s snap in liner. Thanks! - Vanity",
    "comment 5": "Needed a new shower curtain and I wanted one that looked like the ones you see in nice hotels. This waffle weave one fit the bill perfectly. Looks good, easy to install, easy to toss in the wash, the only thing that dropped this down is that the metal rounds at the bottom or way too light to keep the shower in place, so you get the wet cold plastic inner lining hitting your skin. However, my shower head uses a lot of air in it so it blows the water out which makes the curtain billow. If you don't have that type of showerhead then this should be a 5 star for you. - Vincent Smith",
