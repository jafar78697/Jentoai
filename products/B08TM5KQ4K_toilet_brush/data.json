    "comment 1": "I typically use disposable toilet bowl cleaners, but after they kept falling apart, I decided to switch to a more permanent option\u2014and this one did not disappoint. The handle is very sturdy, and the bristles are firm enough to really scour and thoroughly clean the toilet bowl. I especially love the self-opening and closing container; it\u2019s a great design feature that helps to keep the brush hidden and hygienic. The container is a good size and discreet enough to hide nicely behind the toilet when not in use. This is a durable, well-made cleaning tool and I\u2019m very happy with this purchase. - Jeanne Davis",
    "comment 2": "This is actually a really nice toilet brush (if there is such a thing). I like that the top of the container conceals the brush and it\u2019s easy to get in and out. It has stayed relatively clean and is a good size. - Jessica Kowalczik",
    "comment 3": "It\u2019s fine. Kinda cheap looking but, it\u2019s works and blends in to my bathroom decor. - Carla",
    "comment 4": "I purchased two of these.  I\u2019m glad I did.  Both worked perfectly as described. Attractive and good quality. If I needed another one I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to. - Kenneth Cook",
