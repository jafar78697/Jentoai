    "comment 1": "These surprised me by how good they are. They do really good. Very easy to assemble, they stay locked in place pretty well, and they're just as tough as a normal toilet brush and I like the fact that they're black instead of the plain ole white ones. Perfect size,and they look better cause of the color, makes them different. - J",
    "comment 2": "Works great, love the color as it matches both of my bathrooms. Super easy to assemble and is super light. The price is fantastic for 2. Recieved them the next day just as it said when I ordered them. - Kara Chipley",
    "comment 3": "Perfect! Our house keeper wanted one, so this is what we got her. She seems very pleased with it as there has been no complaints and she is kinda inclined to complain. But my dad asks me - do you want her job? Obviously not so I just let her complain about things since she is a good cleaner at an affordable price. She is happy with this toilet brush thankfully! - Matt",
    "comment 4": "Cheap butt does the job. Inexpensive cleaner. - Josh",
    "comment 5": "It\u2019s convenient to have a toilet brush next to each toilet.  The holder is sturdy and keeps the brush in an upright position for storage.  The brush quality is surprisingly good (stiff bristles, but not too stiff).  And the shape facilitates easy and thorough cleaning of the tighter bottom sections of the bowl, under the entire rim, and all the surface area in between.  The handle is comfortable.  At first, I kept partially unscrewing the handle from the brush when I shoved the brush down into those tighter angled parts at the bottom of the bowl.  I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019m left handed or just because I was twisting the brush counterclockwise.  I\u2019m now in the habit of twisting clockwise instead.  No more unscrewing.  I\u2019ll definitely reorder these when the time comes.  Hopefully they\u2019ll still be available on Amazon. - K+S in STL",
