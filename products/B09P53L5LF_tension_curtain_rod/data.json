    "comment 1": "Perfect for hanging garland in my doorway! It\u2019s strong enough to hold the garland plus battery pack which required 3 AA batteries. I like how super easy it is to assemble. I did use the adhesive things that came with it for extra stability because I felt like if I didn\u2019t use them then perhaps overtime the rod may adjust itself or fall because of the heaviness of the battery pack. All in all it is worth it for the price and does its job. - Daniela",
    "comment 2": "The quality is good. The rods are sturdy. They have great tension! My curtains are small, but the tension is so good I feel like they could hold heavier curtains. - Amazon Customer",
    "comment 3": "Works good, need some more adhesive tension rod retainer. I looked to see if sold separately. Please in need other than that, there \ud83d\udcaf - Donna J.",

    "comment 5": "This was perfect for a sheer curtain under blackout drapes. Weight is perfect for this. This is the 3rd spring tension rod I\u2019ve purchased and by far the easiest to install. I purchased white and it works well with decor. Length is perfect for inside my window frame. Holds well. - Pat M.",
