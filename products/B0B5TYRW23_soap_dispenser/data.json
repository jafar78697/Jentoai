    "comment 1": "Wife had bought something like this at a discount store and the pump part did not work and was plain. This one looks nice in our kitchen and works perfect for our dish soap as a dispenser. Price was cheaper then the one at the discount store. This one also held a lot more soap then the other one. Good item - Paul Campa",
    "comment 2": "This is a beautiful, simple, yet classy looking, quality soap dispenser with hat works great! - An honest American",
    "comment 3": "Really nice item. I bought for a bathroom double sink and they are really pretty! I have had several months and the metal still looks great( that was my biggest concern). Easy to refill and the glass is thick so I am not worried about it easily breaking. Came with little rope tags with a wooden disc on it that I didn\u2019t know what to do with so I just took them off. - Amazon customer.",
    "comment 4": "This is a nice soap dispenser.  It has a classic look that dresses up the bathroom and the dispenser dispenses easily.  I save money by buying bulk liquid soap and using this instead of buying disposable bottles every time which don\u2019t even look as nice. - Lmfs",
    "comment 5": "Perfect soap dispenser if you are looking for something durable but clean and modern. It has a thick and durable glass (it makes it heavy but you know it will not break easily). The pump works with no real force and effect. Clear color with the silver pump makes it look modern and nice. Holds a lot of soap with the large capacity. Great purchase - Carlo K",
