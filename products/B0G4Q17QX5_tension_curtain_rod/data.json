    "comment 1": "Doesn\u2019t fit a certain slot-size. My window is 70.5\u201d and should fit well within the 41\u201d-139\u201d that it claims. However with just the adjustable rod it only goes to 65\u201d, then when I attach the long extension rod (they didn\u2019t send me a short) it makes it 73.5\u201d, which is too long. Very frustrating. Contacted the company as I feel like it should\u2019ve come with a short extension rod too, then I\u2019d be able to make it fit. Will change the review if the company sends me the short extension to fix things.*Update*Seller was VERY responsive and sent the right part out immediately. It fits perfectly and securely in my window and it feels very stable. Great option for people who are renting who don't want to do any damage to the walls. - Emily",
