    "comment 1": "Very easy to install, seems sturdy once put up and looks great. I like that you can move the shelves where you want. I tried the stick on shelves before this and none worked. These are pretty easy to use. Sizing is great for all of our shower supplies and the added hooks the side is a great way to maximize storage. Would recommend. - Kylee",
    "comment 2": "I purchased this shower caddy about 2 months ago, and it\u2019s been a great fit for our family of four. The two large shelves are perfect for those of us with more shower items, and the smaller shelves have spots to hang loofahs or body scrubbers, which is really convenient.It was easy to assemble and feels very sturdy. So far, we haven\u2019t had any issues with chipping or rusting. Very happy with this purchase feel it was worth the money. - Lisa",
    "comment 3": "This is a sturdy, functional and very nice looking accessory. I was pleasantly surprised at how simple installation was. Also, activating the 24 month warranty online was a breeze. Im very happy with my purchase. I definitely feel like I got my money's worth and more. Im going to buy another for the opposite corner of my shower just to put small plants on. It is a lovely piece! - Trish P",
