    "comment 3": "Hey!  This is a woman-owned family business.  We used these towels when we lived on a boat. I still use them living on land now. These are pretty, lightweight,  easy to wash. Quick to dry. Good for all esp kids. I give them to guests and they give me a side look bc ppl are used to heavy towels. These dry you quickly. Are very absorbable. I just love them. Worth the price. Remember woman-owned family business. You won\u2019t regret buying.  Also I used these towels bc they don\u2019t break the hair when you wrap up your hair when wet. \ud83c\udf39 - YouNeverKnow1519",
    "comment 4": "I've bought 3 Turkish towels here on Amazon, all different brands from different companies/manufacturers.  Of the 3, this is by far the softest. The other 2 were also a bit smaller or less absorbent. This brand is easy care, launders well with a minimal amount of shrinkage. It doesn't shed or pill. It takes up less shelf room in the linen closet and has multiple uses; it's a perfect tablecloth for the picnic table and works great as a beach blanket. It's lightweight too and did I mention how soft? But for me, Turkish towels in general have a down side. During summer with the air-conditioning on, I frequently chill when I first step out of the shower. These towels provide zero warmth! I miss the way a normal fluffy towel traps body heat in.  I find the tassels on each end very aggravating as they catch in my hair, my glasses or on any corner or sharp edge of the bathroom cabinet. After a few washes, those tassels just become tangled strings that aren't attractive at all.  Turkish towels also seem to pick easy. I can't let my cat around them as her claws seem to always catch and pick. She has no effect on traditional bath towels. If these negatives won't bother you, then I'd highly recommend this brand of turkish towels. - Tammy Wilmot",
    "comment 5": "I looked at many different Turkish towels before ordering this WETCAT towel.  We have a pool in our backyard, and I wanted a lightweight towel to sit on in an Adirondack chair that would have 3 qualities: quick drying, absorbent, and soft. Many of the reviews I read of other towels indicated that the towel had two of my three qualities, but failed on the third.  I'm happy to say that this towel meets all 3 of my requirements.Know, though, before you buy this product, that a Turkish towel is different from a traditional terrycloth or terry-velour beach towel.  It's thin woven cotton.  This towel is thicker than a bedsheet or a button-down shirt, but thinner than denim/chambray.Despite being thin, this towel is fairly absorbent.  Is it as absorbent as a 20 year old towel that's been laundered hundreds of times?  No.  But it is far more effective at removing water droplets from your skin than many cheap beach towels I've bought over the years.  The cotton is soft, and it's comfortable to sit on if you are not looking for something plushy.  For instance, if you normally fold your terrycloth beach towel and sit on it in a beach chair as though it's a cushion, this is not the towel for you.  If, like me, you primarily throw a towel on your chair to keep your sweaty skin from sticking to the chair, then this towel works well.Finally, this towel dries MUCH quicker than a terrycloth beach towel.  I spend a lot of time reading by the pool, hopping in and out to cool off.  After a few dips in the pool, a standard beach towel is usually completely soaked.  This towel dries quickly enough that I can sit on one end while the other end hangs over the back of my chair and dries.  By the time I'm ready to hop back in the pool and cool off, I can turn the towel around and it will be mostly dry.  Water tends to flow through the towel and collect in the little tassels on the ends, leaving the fabric ready to wick the pool water away from my skin again.Bonus: this towel is pretty big!  It's smaller than a \"bath sheet\" sized beach towel, but bigger than many \"large sized\" beach towels you'd find at a department store.  I also read reviews of other Turkish towels that needed to be washed before the first use or that bled dye onto people's clothes or beach bags.  I used this one right out of the package, and it was fine.  It also drapes nicely, and is easy to use as a wrap or cover-up.All in all, I'm pretty happy with this purchase, and I will probably buy another one. - Teachermom",
