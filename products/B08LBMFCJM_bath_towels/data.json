    "comment 3": "They are nice and large. The only drawback is that they are pretty thin for bath towels. They are fine for the cost though  and are serviceable. - Richard A.",
    "comment 4": "I love these towels so soft ad the extra 3 inches is so much nicer. Unlike bath sheets which are too big and take longer to dry, these wonderful towels go all the way around you and dry in the same amount of timr - Nancee",
