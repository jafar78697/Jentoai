    "comment 1": "I will be purchasing more of these!This is a very simple to use easy to fill soap dispenser! It dispenses the perfect amount of foaming hand soap!Charging is done conveniently with a provided USB C cord, and the battery seems to last for quite some time!Filling is super simple, just twist the bottom a quarter turn, it separates and you just fill and replace!I filled it with generic foaming hand soap and it worked perfectly right away.It\u2019s not as large as the photos seem to make it look, I would argue that it\u2019s the perfect size actually. Not very big, and although loud when dry, it\u2019s not at all obnoxious once you have soap in it.It comes with 2 wall mount self adhesive mounts so you can mount on a wall if you\u2019d like.Great sleek design, looks great in many applications. Works great. - Guy Gleason",
