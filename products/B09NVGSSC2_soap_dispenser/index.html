I really like not touching the dispenser every time I wash my hands.  This is an economical choice that is battery operated.  I use a generic liquid soap that is diluted with water in the canister so that it flows easier.  It has a less wasteful squirt and works pretty well.  Not all squirts are equal. It requires 4 AA batteries.  I definitely prefer this dispenser to pumps for cleanliness reasons.  However, I would probably need to upgrade for the dispenser to be more substantial.  That said I’m glad I bought it and I’m sticking with it as long as it lasts.  The batteries seem to last a reasonable amount of time.  The kitchen dispenser has been the first to require replacement batteries after several months. Bedroom bathroom continues to perform."

                        "We LOVE this automatic liquid soap dispenser!!!  It works as advertised. We've placed it with the front edge of the base even with the edge of the sink. Any extra drips and drops go into the sink rather than on the counter.  We wash our hands pretty frequently, and this dispenser also helps us cut down on waste of liquid soap. The main erason we purchased is to cut down on the drippy small soap squirty bottle mess on the counter.  It definitely does that quite well.  The refill hole in the top of the unit is large, so it is SO much easier to reload from the giant bulk bottle of liquid soap of our choice.  That's another big plus!  The exterior is shiny, slick chrome plastic, so if you should get some soap or other stuff on it, it will wipe or rinse off easily.  Love this dispenser and highly recommend.  This took care of something that has annoyed me daily for three years at a very reasonable price.NOTE:It is a bit bulky, so measure the spot you tend to place it in. This is in our master bath with a double sink and long counter, so space wasn't an issue.  It needs a flat spot to sit on to work effectively."
