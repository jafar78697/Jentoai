    "comment 1": "Excellent foam dispensers.I use this in each of our bathrooms with dial foam soap.It works well.Great size,looks nice in the bathroom decor,soap easily dispenses without delay and easy to use. Great value for money.Would buy again and would highly recommend. - Celestial20",
    "comment 2": "I actually came across this hack on TikTok and decided to try using a foaming soap dispenser for my tanning solution. It works way better than I expected and I think it\u2019s the pump. It gives the solution a nice even foam that make's application smoother and feels like a foaming tanner you buy. The dispenser itself feels sturdy and I haven\u2019t had leaks or drips plus it\u2019s easy to clean out. For something that wasn\u2019t even designed for tanning products  it\u2019s become one of my favorite little hacks and it\u2019s definitely worth grabbing if you self-tan regularly and want the liquid solution without the spray portion. - Katelynn Miller",

    "comment 4": "This foaming soap dispenser is very handy to have right next to the sink for washing up, or for charging the dishwashing sponge with a little extra soap. It also allows you to save a little money by only half-filling the bottle with liquid dishwashing liquid (I use Palmolive) and then filling the rest of the way with hot water, mixing with a spoon handle until it's fully mixed. Even diluted with half water, the foam that it dispenses is nice and creamy, not thin and watery. The price is great for the pair, so you can equip multiple sinks.The only downside on this dispenser is that the top of the plunger/spout is very smooth and slants towards the back, so that if your hand is wet, the bottle can slip forward if you're not securing the spout with a finger or two. If the top was flat, pushing straight down on it wouldn't tend to make the plunger slip out from under your hand. But that's a minor quibble. - BAK",
    "comment 5": "These are fantastic. The pumps on my store bought foaming facial cleanser usually get stuck midway and I have to manually push up and down to get the product out. These work very well and hold a full bottle of my facial cleanser. - HW",
