    "comment 1": "I am so impressed with this blush bathroom mat! The color is even prettier in person, soft, warm, and elegant, it adds the perfect touch of style to my bathroom. The material is incredibly plush and feels amazing underfoot, almost like stepping onto a cloud. It absorbs water really well and dries quickly, so it never feels damp or musty.The non-slip backing is a huge plus too, no shifting or sliding, even on tile floors. Overall, this mat exceeded my expectations in every way. If you\u2019re looking to elevate your bathroom with both comfort and style, this is an absolute must-buy!No weird smells!Update: I did buy a second one :) - Fox",
    "comment 2": "These are beautiful, and so far, seem to be much higher quality than most chenille things I purchase. No lint coming off of them, the pile is/loops are thicker than expected, they are super soft and absorbent and they stay out on our bathroom floor. Assuming they wash without deteriorating quickly, I will be buying more in the future. - Christine Allison",
    "comment 3": "This is a very soft rug, but it is a little bit on the small side compared to other bathroom rugs that I have purchased.  I love the black color that coordinates with my black and white tiles - janine",
    "comment 4": "This rug is incredibly soft and cozy feeling. I love the large color option range. I love that I can throw it in the washing machine. I use this rug underneath a litter box! My foster cat throws litter around a bit and this rug catches all of it, doesn\u2019t show it, and holds onto it until I shake it out and wash it. I love love love it. It\u2019s a game changer for the litter box game! High function. High end look. - Sage",
    "comment 5": "Works as intended. Soft to touch. Affordable. I wash them every other week and they hold up. Also use them as mats to go in front of litter box to catch litter. I just dump it back into the litter box and wash. - Heather Lorenz",
