    "comment 1": "Pleasantly surprised by how nice this is! It was easy to pick the size of the rubber ring to get a secure fit, and literally all you do is set it down in the drain. The materials are substantial, heavy, quality materials, and it really stops the water flow. It\u2019s easy to click it open after a bath, and it\u2019s been easy to clean. This was a great, simple replacement for my old, more complicated pop up drain. - Stacie",
    "comment 2": "Perfect fit, nice finish, opens and closes with a toggling action (click down to close, click down again to open...not just pull up and hope it stays). This is just what I needed to fix a tub drain with the center threaded area that had snapped off. - Mike O",
    "comment 3": "Product works as described and easy to install. - Willie",
    "comment 4": "This was one of the best purchases I ever made. Our stopper that came with the original tub was always getting stuck with a full tub of water that needed drained. This was so easy to install we twisted the old stopper out and dropped this one in and that was it. It seems like a pretty universal fit there\u2019s no threading to screw in to fit so I feel like this would work for just about any tub drain. We bought the oil rubbed bronze finish and it matches all of our other fixtures perfectly. - Anna Smothers",
    "comment 5": "I had been using a plastic tub plug for years. It got knocked off the edge of the tub and my Corgi destroyed it. It was time for a replacement and I came across this stopper. I love it! It keeps water in the tub when taking a bath, it perfectly covers the old chrome around the drain, and it works well to catch hair. - beautifulkitty11",
