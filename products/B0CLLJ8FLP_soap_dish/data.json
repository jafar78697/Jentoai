    "comment 1": "Love this soap dish.  No more icky soap.  It drains, doesn't leave soap wet and since water drains off even the soap holder stays nice.  This soap dish makes me happy :) - Grammy",
    "comment 2": "I recently purchased this soap holder for its unique design hoping that it would live up to its hype of keeping my bath soap dry and clean between uses. I\u2019m certainly impressed with the quality and durability of the silicone soap dish and it does truly work! I have mine in my shower and it\u2019s easy to grab the soap and helps keep the soap securely where I place it. It\u2019s perfectly sized for a traditional bar of soap and I\u2019ve had no issues of the soap slipping off when I\u2019m finished using it. It\u2019s fantastic at keeping your soap dry between uses and definitely avoids that awful \u201cslimy goo\u201d effect that occurs when using a traditional soap dish as it sits in water waiting for you to use it again. I didn\u2019t order the one with suction cups because I have my silicone shower soap dish placed in my shower caddy so I can\u2019t comment on the durability and suction power it would or would not have. But, after using this fantastic silicone soap dish for a while I decided I was so pleased with its performance that I just ordered a second one for my spare bathroom. I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who wants a product that solves an issue and works just as described. - Chase",
    "comment 3": "These soap dishes are amazing.  Soap bars don't get squishy or melt in the shower.  Water pours out through the ridges so your soap never sits in water to get slimy.  It just dries out.  They're not pretty and they're heavy but they do a great job. Highly recommended. - SoCal Reader",
