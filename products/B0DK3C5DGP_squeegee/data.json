    "comment 1": "This tool is very easy to use. And it was easy to hang on the shower and it cleans the sides of the walls as well as the doors. I really like it does a great job. And it keeps the bathroom looking clean.Doesn't have romantic streaks. There's a few that I've caught, but I've been able to go back over it and get it done, and it does good. And it does a great job with scraping down the water, so I'm not going to complain.Very lightweight, and it's not hard to hang on to the handle.Is perfect - Happy",
    "comment 2": "This is a wonderful price and product! I'm just be careful when you are pushing really hard on the top, side, and really and straight edge! It *will* cut your finger like a bad paper cut! LOL just a fyi, and it is definitely something I watched out for on the second one! However, they are both there to stay. . . So, excellent product quality and helpful to keep even showers that don't have glass clean because if you squeegee the wall and tub sides (mirror too if you want to use it faster even with a good vent) it will keep it cleaner and dry everything out faster!This means dryer bathroom, less mold/mildew chances, less time running a vent that may not be the best anyway? Etc... - AHAdarlings",
    "comment 3": "These shower squeegees do exactly what they\u2019re supposed to do. They glide smoothly across glass and tile and remove water without leaving streaks behind. Using them regularly has definitely helped keep water spots and soap residue from building up on my shower doors.The handles feel comfortable and lightweight, and the blades are flexible enough to contour to the surface. I like that this is a two-pack, which makes it easy to keep one in the shower and use the other for mirrors or windows. The only minor downside is that they\u2019re fairly basic in design.Overall, these are solid, no-frills squeegees that work well and are a good value. I\u2019m giving four stars because they\u2019re effective and convenient, even if they\u2019re nothing fancy. - fred",
