    "comment 2": "Just installed, so haven\u2019t really used. So far we are pleased with it. I DO suggest following the YouTube video for assistance in putting together and installing as the enclosed directions are hard to read. I also suggest putting the 2 \u201carms\u201d for hanging lower than suggested. You really need to play with it before installing so it\u2019s according to your liking. - Deby L Bretz",
