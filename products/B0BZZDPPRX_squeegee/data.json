    "comment 1": "This squeegee does the trick, it cleans very well, no streaks. It\u2019s also weighted nicely, doesn\u2019t feel flimsy. It also looks very elegant/high end. Great deal for the price.FYI you are supposed to rest it rubber edge out, otherwise a little notch gets made with the rubber leaning against metal. It happened to us, not a huge deal. - Todd Gillman",
    "comment 2": "This stainless steel shower squeegee is sturdy and works great on glass doors and mirrors. The 10-inch size is perfect, and it removes water without leaving streaks. I also love the two adhesive hooks \u2014 easy to install and very convenient. Great quality and very useful for everyday cleaning. - Rosalia Houtmann",

    "comment 4": "I really like this shower squeegee. The stainless steel design looks modern and sturdy, and the two adhesive hooks are very convenient for keeping everything organized. It works perfectly on shower glass doors, mirrors, and windows, leaving surfaces clean and streak-free. The rubber blade glides smoothly and does a great job.I\u2019m giving it 4 stars only because the handle could be a bit more ergonomic, but overall it\u2019s an excellent product that works just as described. - Mar\u00eda del Pilar",
    "comment 5": "This squeegee works extremely well.  The rubber blade is thin enough to be flexible so you only need one swipe to remove all of the water where you're working.  I had purchased a different brand with a thicker blade which was not flexible.  That other squeegee took several swipes to actually get all the water off the walls and floor of the shower.I'm very please with this product. - FairwayLife",
