    "comment 1": "Exactly as expected. Looks nicer n person. I don't like the curtain liner but that's an easy fix. Decent quality, possibly better than what I paid for it. Pretty deep color too! - Kate",

    "comment 4": "We recently moved into a new home, and I wanted to give my teenager's bathroom a fresh, cohesive look. The Clara Clark Bathroom Accessories Set in green caught my eye, and it turned out to be a fantastic choice.\u200bThe set includes everything we needed: a shower curtain with liner, bath mats, a toothbrush holder, soap dispenser, soap dish, trash can, toilet brush with holder, and even matching hooks. The green color is modern and richl, fitting seamlessly with the bathroom's decor.\u200bThe shower curtain is made of durable polyester with a waffle texture, and the included liner has weighted magnets to keep it in place. The bath mats are plush and absorbent, with non-slip backing that ensures safety.\u200bAll the accessories feel sturdy and well-made. The soap dispenser and toothbrush holder have a sleek design, and the trash can and toilet brush holder are compact yet functional.\u200bMy teenager loves the new setup, and the bathroom now feels more organized and stylish. This set made it easy to achieve a coordinated look without the hassle of buying individual pieces.\u200b - Julie Marie",
    "comment 5": "The slip resistance is pretty good overall. The pieces stay in place on the counter and don\u2019t slide around easily during everyday use. They feel sturdy and well made, and the set looks very clean and modern in the bathroom.On very smooth or wet surfaces, there can be a little movement, but nothing major. For normal bathroom use, it does the job well and adds a nice, cohesive look to the space. - Sh\u00e9net S. Callwood",
