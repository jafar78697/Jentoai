It has enough space to hold multiple towels, which is great for my family.I was pleasantly surprised by how energy-efficient this towel warmer is. It doesn\u2019t consume much electricity, which is a plus for my utility bills.It has truly transformed my bathroom experience. If you\u2019re considering adding a towel warmer to your home, this one is definitely worth it! - Raquel",
    "comment 4": "I've had this towel warmer for 4 years now and it has worked great. Early on, the lid became separated, and I had to super glue it together, but then I didn't have any problems. (No, the glue did not melt when the towel warmer is on). The warmer shuts off after about 1 hr for safety and heats up quickly after that.Fast forward 4 years (ordered it in October 2021) and it is now turning on by itself (or staying on rather than auto shut off) and over-heating! I came into my bathroom the other night and it smelled like something was burning, and I see the towel warmer was on!? (We shower in the mornings. So, either it didn't auto-shut off and was on all day, or it turned on by itself) So, we have been unplugging it more regularly. However, when I do use it, it does not seem to be auto turning off and it gets too hot. It is the first time I've experienced this with this product and I'm thinking it's time to get a new one. I'm sad though, because this seems like a waste to throw in the landfill. However, it's no longer safe if we forget to unplug it and if the towels feel like they might burn you. Again, this only recently started happening after about 4 years. Otherwise I feel like it's worth it! I even bought one for my mom when we bought ours. Maybe I should check on hers!! \ud83d\ude2c - A. M",
