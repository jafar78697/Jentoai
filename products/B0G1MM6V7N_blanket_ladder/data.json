    "comment 1": "I am using it just inside the exterior bedroom door that leads to our hot tub area. It works perfectly for holding towels, clothes, and an extra blanket for cold evenings. It adds storage without taking up much floor space and fits the purpose I bought it for very well. Assembly was straightforward and the instructions were clear enough that nothing felt confusing. All of the pieces were well labeled, which helped the process go smoothly. Design-wise, this works well overall. I do think the top shelf would feel more balanced if it were mounted toward the front instead of putting the weight on the back and taking additional space between the unit and the wall, especially if someone wanted to use it fully freestanding. That said, once it is leaned against the wall or secured as intended, it feels sturdy and stable. For the price, this is a solid piece. - Giggly1",
    "comment 2": "This rustic farmhouse 7-tier ladder shelf for hanging blankets or towels is a stylish way to decorate any room in your house. I chose to decorate and organize a bathroom in my home to give it a contemporary look. The ladder combines a blend of durable wood and iron that stabilizes and stands a little over 5ft in height. The directions are easy to read and simple to assembly. Also included are 4 hooks at the top to hang hats or other decorative items and 4 adjustable feet at the bottom for a perfect leveled height. The ladder also includes materials to anchor and stabilize the ladder to the wall. Overall, this stylish ladder shelf is a beautiful decorative piece to organize any room of your home and is well worth the price. - Mathury",
    "comment 3": "I really love this blanket ladder \u2014 it\u2019s a great combination of form and function. It was simple to put together, and once assembled it feels sturdy and well balanced.It holds multiple throw blankets neatly while keeping them visible and easy to grab, which helps prevent that \u201cpile on the couch\u201d look. I especially like that it fits nicely into a small or unused corner and instantly becomes a functional design element in the room rather than just storage.The overall look is clean and attractive, and it doesn\u2019t feel flimsy or decorative-only \u2014 it\u2019s actually very functional. This works well in a living room or bedroom where you want blankets accessible but organized.Overall, it\u2019s a well-designed, practical piece that looks great while keeping things tidy. I\u2019m very happy with it. - Jan lansk",
    "comment 4": "It is the perfect size for what I needed. It was a definite upgrade from what I had and it makes my lanoon closet much more organized and it took me about 40 minutes to put together. I did not attach it to the wall which is an option but just in case I want to move it somewhere else. I didn't want to do that. It's definitely worth the money and I would recommend someone buying it - Heather Allen",
    "comment 5": "Great item! It was easy to install and it\u2019s sturdy enough for our throw blankets. I do praise the functionally, it definitely goes us space back and it\u2019s looks great! - TSam",
