    "comment 1": "Pretty neutral tan color. Very durable and well made material. It's like a braided like design and texture. Nice and thick material, definitely not cheap. It's very simple but elegant. Holds a square tissue box perfectly. Easy to put the tissue box in and out of it. Sits nicely on my end table, doesn't take up that much space. Functions just as it should. Worth the price. - ItTakesAllOfUs",
    "comment 2": "It looks elegant and is soft but sturdy. Easy to cover the tissue box and made well. The Gold is an attractive color. - Debbie",
    "comment 3": "Very nice tissue holder. Feels like leather and is super cute.  Arrived quickly and was packaged well.  I've had it a few weeks now and the crease (from being folded in packaging) has not quite gone away yet. I'm hoping it will continue to straighten out in a bit more time. - My3Cents",
    "comment 4": "I have bought I think four in total. Love the look to the room of having the Kleenex box covered. Just elevates the space more. Love all the colors so far. Wish the creases came out a little more so it was flat on all sides but I also haven\u2019t put a lot of effort in to making them flat. Will buy more. Appreciate the Velcro strap underneath which helps with it being sturdy. - Brooke Jones",
    "comment 5": "It\u2019s very pretty and the material looks nice. It looks just like the pictures would definitely recommend. - OBED TORRES",
