    "comment 1": "I absolutely love this tissue box holder! The woven design looks high-end and adds the perfect warm, natural touch to my powder room. It instantly made the space look more put-together and elevated \u2014 like something you\u2019d see in a boutique hotel or home decor magazine.The quality is excellent. It feels sturdy, well-made, and holds the tissue box securely without slipping or collapsing. I also love how the opening is just the right size so tissues pull out smoothly without bunching or tearing.It blends beautifully with my countertop decor and adds a cozy, spa-like vibe to the room. I\u2019ve already had guests compliment it because it looks so chic and unique compared to plain plastic tissue boxes.Highly recommend if you want something functional that also looks beautiful on your bathroom counter! - Warryn Lim",
    "comment 2": "Such a great little tissue box cover. I bought this to use in my office. It\u2019s very well made and fits into my office decor well. It is really good quality for the price and I would definitely buy even if it was a little more expensive. The weave on this is good and not loose at all, so I\u2019m not worried about it falling apart later. The elastic on the bottom keeps the tissue box in place which I found to be an added bonus. Absolutely beautiful. - Dawn P.",

Good quality and good value for the money. The bottom has a band that keeps the box inside too. - Gianna",
