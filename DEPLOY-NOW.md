## What I Fixed

✅ Removed all API dependencies  
✅ Chat widget works with pre-programmed responses  
✅ All forms show success messages without webhooks

## 3 Simple Steps to Deploy

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to: `https://github.com/jafar78697/Jentoai/settings/pages`
2. Under **"Source"**, click the dropdown
3. Select **"GitHub Actions"**
4. Done! (No need to click Save, it auto-saves)

### Step 2: Push Your Code

Open your terminal/command prompt in your project folder and run:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Remove APIs and deploy to GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```

**OR** if you use GitHub Desktop:
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Write commit message: "Remove APIs and deploy to GitHub Pages"
3. Click "Commit to main"
4. Click "Push origin"

### Step 3: Wait and Visit

3. Visit your live site: **https://jafar78697.github.io/Jentoai/**

## That's It!

Your site will now automatically update every time you push code to GitHub.

## What Works Now
